            <p>I usually work with game engines to craft unique experiences. </p>
            <p> I’ve dabbled in programming since a young age but 3D is my main craft. </p>
            <p>I started off crafting environments but since I started working professional I’ve been focusing more on the technical aspect of building things.</p> 
            <p>I work with modern software like Unity, UE4, Blender, 3Ds Max, Houdini, ZBrush and Substance.  </p>
            <p>I usually code in C#, Python, JavaScript and I’ve crafted this website using HTML & CSS.</p>
