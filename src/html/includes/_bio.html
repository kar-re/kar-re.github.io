                <p>I usually work with game engines to craft unique experiences. 
                 I’ve dabbled in programming since a young age but 3D is my main craft. 
                I started off crafting environments but since I started working professionally I’ve been focusing more on the technical aspects. <br>
                I work with modern software like Unity, UE4, Blender, 3Ds Max, Houdini, ZBrush, the Substance suite and Adobe products. <br>  
                I usually write code in C#, Python, JavaScript and I’ve crafted this website using HTML & CSS.</p>
